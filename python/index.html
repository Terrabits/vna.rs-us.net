title: Python VNA Driver
---
<p>
  The python package <b>rohdeschwarz</b> provides a VNA instrument driver for python 2.7/3.
</p>

<h3>Install</h3>
<p>
  As you would expect, you can install <b>rohdeschwarz</b> from the command line with pip:
  {% highlight ruby %}
    pip install rohdeschwarz
  {% endhighlight %}
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
  The <b>pyvisa</b> and <b>numpy</b> python packages must be installed.
  <br />
  There is a direct tcp socket option if you prefer to connect to the instrument without installing VISA on the host machine. However, the <b>pyvisa</b> package is still required at the moment.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
  The following code snippet will attempt to connect to an instrument via TCPIP at the address provided (in this example on the local system).
  {% highlight python %}
from rohdeschwarz.instruments.vna import *

vna = Vna()
vna.open('TCPIP', '127.0.0.1')

#
# Continue with vna driver...
#
  {% endhighlight %}
</p>
