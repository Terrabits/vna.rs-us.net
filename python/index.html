title: Python VNA Driver
---
<p>
  The python package <b>rohdeschwarz</b> provides a VNA instrument driver for python 2.7/3.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
  The <b>pyvisa</b> and <b>numpy</b> python packages must be installed. Numpy is tricky to install because it includes python language extensions written in C that must be compiled for your specific platform. The easiest way to accommodate this is to find a precompiled version of python and numpy that work together. Download each, install python first and then install numpy. Then pip install rohdeschwarz.
  <br />
  There is a direct tcp socket option if you prefer to connect to the instrument without installing VISA on the host machine. However, the <b>pyvisa</b> package is still required at the moment, even if it is not used.
</p>

<h3>Install</h3>
<p>
  As you would expect, you can install <b>rohdeschwarz</b> from the command line with pip:
</p>
  {% highlight ruby %}
    pip install --pre rohdeschwarz
  {% endhighlight %}
<p>
  The <i>--pre</i> flag indicates that you are okay with a version of rohdeschwarz that is "pre-release" (beta).
</p>



<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
  The following code snippet will attempt to connect to an instrument via VISA and GPIB at the address provided.
</p>
  {% highlight python %}
from rohdeschwarz.instruments.vna import Vna

vna = Vna()
vna.open('GPIB', '17')
vna.open_log('path/to/scpi/log.txt')
  {% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Alternatively, to connect via a direct TCP socket (no VISA installation required):
</p>

    {% highlight python %}
from rohdeschwarz.instruments.vna import Vna

vna = Vna()
vna.open_tcp('192.168.1.101')
vna.open_log('path/to/scpi/log.txt')
  {% endhighlight %}
